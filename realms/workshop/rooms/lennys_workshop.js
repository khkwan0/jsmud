You notice this place is a little messy since there are many half finished inventions scattered about including bits, pieces, and tools.  It is lit with candles that burn forever with a magical air condition unit that makes no noise and works flawlessly.  There are no apparent doors or windows here.  You feel very safe and at ease here.  You notice a desk with a very powerful desktop computer with 8 monitors. On one of the monitors you notice a recent broadband speed test that registered 100000000000 Mbps.",
