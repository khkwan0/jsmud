It is in the corner office on the 5th floor of the 9000 building on Sunset Blvd.  The office has floor to ceiling windows with a great view of West Hollywood and since it's a clear day, you can see downtown LA from here.  There is a large desk with 2 large 30 inch monitors atop th desk.  You also see a Vewdoo board that is sitting off to the side of the room as well as a couch in front of the desk.  It is rather warm in here.",
